# lowspace
An extra low DPI font that emphasizes readability.

## What sizes does it have (and what is the preferred resolution?)
lowspace is meant (at the moment) for very low DPI displays such as 640x360, 800x600, 960x540 among others.
The current sizes of lowspace (in pixel sizes) include 4 and 5px.

## Character support
lowspace (at the current moment) currently supports the first 255 unicode characters + block characters. I will likely support more characters in the future, but at the current moment the first 255 characters are important.

## To-do list:
* Size 6
* Create an actually decent monospace font
* Support more scripts
* Add block character support for size 4
* Finish up remaining accented characters on size 5
