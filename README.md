# lowspace
An extra low DPI font that tries to be as readable as possible on low resolution displays.

## What sizes does it have (and what is the preferred resolution?)
lowspace is meant (at the moment) for very low DPI displays such as 640x360, 800x600, 960x540 among others.
The current sizes of lowspace (in pixel sizes) include 3, 4 and 5px in width.

## Character support
lowspace (at the current moment) currently supports the first 255 unicode characters + block characters (unless stated otherwise). I will likely support more characters in the future, but at the current moment the first 255 characters are important.

## To-do list:
* Size 6 (it is in the latest pre-release but not ready in the slightest)
* Create an actually decent monospace font
* Support more scripts (for later down the road)
* Complete size 3 block characters
* Adjust width of characters in other sizes
* ~~Add block character support for size 4~~
* ~~Finish size 5 characters up to U+FF~~
